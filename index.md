I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, 
advised by Prof. Gordon Wetzstein. I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I received my B.S. in Bioengineering also at Stanford. As an undergraduate,
I worked on a multitude of molecular bioengineering projects,
including engineering CRISPR systems under the guidance of Prof. Stanley Qi.

At Stanford, I am the Program Director for [STEM to SHTEM](https://compression.stanford.edu/summer-internships-high-school-and-cc-students), a high school research internship program that I co-founded with Prof. Tsachy Weissman. I've written about 
[the importance of fixing educational disparity](https://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/ce/article/view/1117/1112) in 
the Bay Area.
