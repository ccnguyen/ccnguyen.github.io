I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering in the [Stanford Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.computationalimaging.org/), 
advised by [Prof. Gordon Wetzstein](https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/). I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

This past summer, I was fortunate enough to work with [Boris Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-chen-b921a214) and [Yiwei Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-yiwei-zhao-18584a105/) on applying AI to studio production workflows at [Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/). During Summer 2022, I had the pleasure of working with [Kevin Blackburn-Matzen](http://kmatzen.com/), [Simon Niklaus](https://sniklaus.com/welcome), and [Oliver Wang](http://www.oliverwang.info/) at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/).

I am interested in challenges in **computational imaging and photography**, particularly in **deblurring**, **depth estimation**, and **low-light reconstruction** to make image capture resemble more closely what we can experience in real life. I am also interested in seeing how far we can achieve this goal using **generative AI**.

I received my B.S. in Bioengineering also at Stanford. As an undergraduate,
I worked on engineering CRISPR genome editing systems under the guidance of [Prof. Stanley Qi](https://med.stanford.edu/qilab/home.html) (which included a *lot* of pipetting). 

At Stanford, I am the senior advisor for [SHTEM](https://compression.stanford.edu/outreach/stem2shtem-summer-internships-high-schoolers-and-community-college-students), a high school and community college research internship program that I founded with [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](https://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/). If you are eligible to apply, please do so! As a first-generation/low-income student, I'm passionate about helping students from similar backgrounds, so feel free to reach out if you're a minority student interested in pursuing STEM and/or grad school.
