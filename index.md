I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering in the [Stanford Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.computationalimaging.org/), 
advised by Prof. Gordon Wetzstein. I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
 
I am interested in challenges in **computational photography**, particularly in **denoising**, **deblurring**, **depth estimation**, and **HDR imaging** to make image capture resemble more closely what we can experience in real life.

I received my B.S. in Bioengineering also at Stanford. As an undergraduate,
I worked on a multitude of molecular bioengineering projects,
including engineering CRISPR systems under the guidance of Prof. Stanley Qi.

At Stanford, I am the senior advisor for [SHTEM](https://compression.stanford.edu/summer-internships-high-school-and-cc-students), a high school and community college research internship program that I co-founded with Prof. Tsachy Weissman. As a first-generation student, I'm passionate about helping students from similar backgrounds, so feel free to reach out if you're a minority student interested in pursuing STEM and/or grad school.
