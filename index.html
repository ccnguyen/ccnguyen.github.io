			<p>I am a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am interesting in computational modeling (in a variety of contexts!).<br><br>
			 I received my undergraduate degree in Bioengineering also at Stanford. As an undergraduate, I had the privilege of working on a multitude of biology-driven projects, including engineering CRISPR systems under the guidance of Prof. Stanley Qi. Since then, my research interests have moved gradually towards computational problems, and I'm excited to be working on problems in new, growing spaces. </p>
